\section{Image Classification}
Given input data make a prediction to which class it belongs.

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nearest-neighbor classifier
    \item Minimal distance classifier (simple line classifier)
    \item Convolutional networks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Support Vector Machines (SVM)}
From all possible choices of linear functions choose the one that amounts to the largest distance between classes.
Optimizes so that value of the margin is largest.

\subsubsection{Soft Margin SVM}
Optimize: Large margin, minimal penalty from samples on the wrong side

\subsubsection{Nonlinear SVM}
Transform problem into higher dimensional space, where the data is linearly separable
